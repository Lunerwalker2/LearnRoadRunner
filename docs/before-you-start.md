# Before You Start!

::: warning
Please make sure to take note of the following before continuing!

::: tip

**1.** This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Java programming language and the FTC SDK. Experience in both come with both time and practice. Don't worry. Even if you think you don't know much right now, you'll be great after pumping out some more code ðŸ‘Š.

**2.** These concepts are hard and can be difficult to navigate. This tutorial tries to make it as easy as possible to navigate but it's not everyone's cup of tea. If you ever need help, there are a ton of lovely people on the [FTC Discord](https://discord.gg/first-tech-challenge)! I highly recommend you join as they are wonderful, very smart, and many are experienced in Road Runner!

**3.** This tutorial attempts to cover installation, usage, and tips and tricks. It does not go into the hardcore inner workings of Road Runner. However, a deep understanding of how PID control and motion profiles work will make the learning process much faster. I highly recommend you check Road Runner's [original quickstart documentation](https://acme-robotics.gitbook.io/road-runner/quickstart/introduction) as it explains the inner workings.

::: warning
It is highly recommended to have ample room during the tuning process. This will allow for more accuracy. I personally recommend of having a clear stretch of up to 90 inches for your robot to drive on. You should have a minimum of an entire field width (72 inches) to tune on.
