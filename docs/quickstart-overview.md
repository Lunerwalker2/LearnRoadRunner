# High Level Overview

Before we get started, it's important to understand what everything is doing.

::: tip
This page roughly mirrors the tuning guide on Road Runner's official quickstart. Consider reading it for a more thorough overview.

:::

Road Runner handles all the fancy math to get everything up and running. However, you must tune everything so it handles as smooth as possible for your specific bot. Different bots with varying motors, weights, etc, all contribute to discrepancies in drive train behavior. Thus, one must follow the tuning guide to ensure that your drivetrain behavior is properly characterized.

::: warning
Significant changes to your bot (addition of a heavy mechanism, etc.) will necesitate a retuning. Although the tuning process should be much faster, this is recommended to ensure consistent behavior.

## Are You Using Drive Encoders?

Before you begin tuning, it is important to understand feedforward vs. PID velocity control and which one you are using. The goal of both of the systems is to reach and mantain a target velocity. The feedforward velocity control is an open loop system that will attempt to create a function translating voltage into velocity using specified drive characteristics. In contrast, the velocity PID is a closed loop system. It allows for live feedback and adjustment of the velocity using the readouts from an encoder. In general, a closed loop system will be most optimal. Thus, if you are able to, turn on `RUN_USING_ENCODERS` on each of your drive train motors to achieve the smoothest behavior. However, if you are using drive encoders with a three-wheel odometry setup (assuming 4x motors on the drive train), this will take up 7 out of your 8 available encoder slots leaving you with a single usable encoder slot for other robot mechanisms. This is not always possible and sacrificing your drive train encoders frees up 4 encoder slots. In this scenario, you would use the feedforward velocity control.
You should not be depending on feedforward velocity control without dead-wheels.

The tuning process will differ depending on which form of control you use.

## Drive Constants

The drive constants file will include everything regarding the physical characteristics of the bot. This includes motor's max RPM, wheel radius, etc. Most errors in the process manifest themselves in this stage. For example, if your robot is traveling half the distance specified, this is most likely a problem in your drive constants. Please check the [drive constants page](/drive-constants) page for further details.

## Dead Wheels

If your bot has dead-wheels, they should be configured after editing your drive constants. If not, ignore this stage. Don't know what dead-wheels are? Check out [the example in the FAQ](/#what-are-dead-wheels-odometry).
Tuning of the dead-wheels should be performed in the localization test. Proper tuning of the dead-wheels is very important for accurate localization and following.

Your configuration will depend on whether you have two or three dead-wheels. Don't know the difference? Check [the FAQ](/#what-is-the-difference-between-two-and-three-wheel-odometry).

## Localization Test

Running the localization test and driving the robot around the field will allow you to see any discrepancies with your bot's localization. Drive encoder localization or dead-wheel localization should both be tuned here. Accuracy of the path following will be dramatically affected by the localization accuracy.

The `DriveVelocityPIDTuner` opmode is used to tune the Rev Hub's built in motor velocity PIDs (the `RUN_USING_ENCODER` mode). It is imperative that you tune the coefficients of the PID. This will ensure optimal, consistent behavior. These PIDs should be tuned after any large modifications to the bot affecting weight. Run this opmode and adjust the PID gains. You can adjust the PID gains to get your desired behavior. The official Road Runner docs recommend that you should "prioritize eliminating phase lag even at the cost of some extra oscillations." However, I personally feel that it is better to try and minimize oscillations, especially towards the zero velocity. I found that eliminating phase lag, especially at high speeds, would cause very jittery motion. My personal advice would be to minimize oscillations and allow for the translational PID to fix any phase lag discrepancies.

I can't really say it any better myself so I am just going to paste the official Road Runner quickstart guide for this section ðŸ˜›:

> To find `kV` and `kStatic`, the robot executes a quasi-static ramp test where the voltage is slowly ramped up to minimize acceleration (it's effectively zero). Throughout this procedure, the velocity and voltage are recorded. In the corresponding velocity vs. voltage graph, `kV` is the slope and `kStatic` is the y-intercept. Next, to find `kA`, the robot attempts to accelerate rapidly from rest. This time, the acceleration, velocity, and voltage are recorded. The velocity is used to determine the acceleration-only voltage. The acceleration is then graphed against this new voltage, and the resulting slope is `kA`.
> This procedure is implemented in DriveFeedforwardTuner. The DS telemetry prompts will guide you through the process. If you want to do some analysis yourself, the tuner also saves the data to /sdcard/RoadRunner on the RC.

## Straight Test

Straight test is used to determine how effective your feedfoward/velocity PID tuning turned out. Run the `StraightTest` opmode a few times. If the bot consistently reaches the same measurement a few times within a few inches, these tunings were successful. It does not need to hit the exact spot each time as you will later enable closed loop feedback using localization.

If your `StraightTest` distance if consistent but off, scale the drive wheel radius to reach this distance. Then, add a strafe into the `StraightTest` to tune the `lateralMultiplier`.

## TrackWidthTuner

Track width is the distance from one wheel to the parallel wheel. Although this is a physical measurement, the effective track width will differ from real world measurements due to a number of possibilities. To account for this discrepancy, run the `TrackWidthTuner` opmode to compute the empirical track width.

You will find that `TrackWidthTuner` will only get within an inch or so of your desired empirical track width. You will most likely need to hand-tune the track width by running the `TurnTest` opmode and editing the track width in the drive constants.

## Turn Test

Run the turn test to confirm your track width is correct.

## FollowerPIDTuner

You will tune two PIDs in this step, the heading PID and the translational (x/y) PID. This enables closed-loop feedback control to ensure accurate path following. The `FollowerPIDTuner` opmode will have your bot follow a square path, allowing you to simultaneously tune the heading and translational PID. However, I personally recommend tuning the heading and translational PID while running the bot back and forth in a straight line. This alleviates the frustration of having to reset your bot after it drifts off the square path and hits a wall. After it works well enough in this case, then run `FollowerPIDTuner` for additional fine tuning.

## Spline Test

After everything is tuned, your bot should follow spline paths accurately. If spline test goes wrong, identify the problem and go back to the respective step and retune. Don't be afraid to ask the [FTC Discord](https://discord.gg/first-tech-challenge) if you're stuck!
